            <p><strong>Breeding:</strong> Blue-and-Yellow Macaws breed once a year, typically during the early part of the year. They usually nest in cavities of large trees.</p>
            <p><strong>Eggs:</strong> The female typically lays 2-3 eggs, which are incubated for about 28 days.</p>
            <p><strong>Chicks:</strong> After hatching, the chicks remain in the nest for about 3 months, during which both parents feed and care for them. The young macaws depend on their parents for food until they learn to fly.</p>
            <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> In the wild, these macaws can live for 30-35 years. In captivity, with proper care, they can live up to 50-60 years.</p>
